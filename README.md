# Project_2

Project 2 is an exercise of extracting, transforming, and loading of data, which is know also as ETL. Excel files containing the information for several crowdfunded projects and another file containing contact information were extracted into a Jupyter notebook. Next each file, after being converted into four dataframes, was further transformed into a more readable and user friendly format. Afterwards, each dataframe was converted into a csv file and loaded into a sql database.

# Installation
To run this project, the ipynb file and the two xlsx files in the resources folder are needed to create the csv folders that can be loaded into a PostGres database which can be setup with the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file.

# Resources
The activities in week 13 folder contains all the information needed for a majority of the project however, the Rexegg site was used to refernce the information needed to organize the contacts csv.
